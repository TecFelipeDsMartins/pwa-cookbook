About this cookbook
====================

This website is a *cookbook* that serves as a kick-start to help you understand and develop *Progressive Web Apps (PWA)*. It tries to answer questions such as : what are PWA, what are their advantages and drawbacks, how to build one...

Since PWA are based on [progressive enhancement](progressive-enhancement.md), this cookbook also tries to *progressively* teach the PWA subject.

Each page of this cookbook contains tools to assist you during navigation:

- The **prerequisites** to understand a section are indicated on the top right corder of each page. Since the *Introduction* chapter does not need any prerequisite, thus it can be read by anyone.
- The **table of contents** on the left allows to quickly navigate between pages.
- A **search box** is always available on the top right corner of the page **prerequisites**. It allows you to quickly find content.

On final note, **this cookbook is itself a PWA**. In fact, you can now read this cookbook while being offline. If you are using an Android device, you can ask Chrome to add this cookbook to the home screen of your Android launcher.
