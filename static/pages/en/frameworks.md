# PWA features in popular JS frameworks

Addy Osmani gave a talk on this subject during Google IO 2017:

[Production Progressive Web Apps With JavaScript Frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMbSyngXB4)

## React: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

Facebook teams are often ahead of the field regarding PWA development with their React framework. This choice is a safe bet but React is used at its best in the hands of experienced Javascript developers who have some knowledge of functional reactive programming.

This framework provides a tool that allows to very quickly setup a React project. Since its version 1.0, this tool provides a PWA experience by default. This notably includes an auto generated app manifest and a Service Worker configured with an offline-first cache strategy.

On the server side, [Next.js](https://learnnextjs.com/) from Zeit is the most popular option and the simplest to apprehend. Following the example of create-react-app, the team wishes to offer an offline-first approach by default. However, It is not yet the case for the version 4.3.0 which is the latest version at the time of writing.

## Preact: [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli)

Preact is a lightweight alternative (3kb) to React and is baed on the same API, making it very simple to reuse the ecosystem and the tooling associated with React. Its small size makes it particularly well suited for mobiles. In addition to that, its new CLI tool allows to start in 30 seconds a Preact PWA which has a [score of 100/100 on Lighthouse](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/?gist=142af6838482417af741d966e7804346).

We recommend it to React developers who want to further optimize and simplify their tooling.

## Vue.js: [PWA Template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/pwa)

Vue.js is a framework which is more accessible than React and Angular. It takes the best features from concurrent frameworks and merges them into a simple and minimalist solution which is modular and flexible enough to adapt to advanced uses. Vue.js is recommended for beginners and for those who quickly want to get results; such as a POC.

To easily initiate a Vue project, [many templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates) are made available via the `vue-cli` CLI tool. The PWA template - as its name implies - is dedicated to Progressive Web Apps. Its goal is to help us automate, as much as possible, the setup of PWA features.

In the same way that `Next.js` brings server side rendering to React, [Nuxt for Vue](https://nuxtjs.org/) offers practically the same features and the same approach. SÃ©bastien and Alexandre Chopin, the two brothers behind Nuxt, have announced their interest for PWA and want to offer an offline-ready experience by default on Nuxt projects.

## Angular

Angular is more complex to decrypt with regard to PWA. The [Angular Mobile Toolkit](https://github.com/angular/mobile-toolkit) project is the closest thing we can get to an PWA Angular setup, but unfortunately the project looks inactive, perhaps abandonned. Also, they strangely decided to focus on mobile. Even if network quality and processing performance are particularly problematic on mobile platforms, and considering that Android has the most advanced PWA integration to the platform to this day, PWA were never intended to be mobile only. Thus, it is advised to step back and wait a bit longer before considering Angular for a PWA.

## [Polymer](https://news.polymer-project.org/list/top_stories)

It is to be noted that the team behind Polymer, another JS framework made by Google, is very proactive on PWA. This can also be an option to consider, even though it has more restricted usage possibilities than other generalist frameworks.
